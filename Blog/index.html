            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>"Atomic Habits" by James Clear is a bestselling self-help book that explores the science of habit formation and offers actionable strategies to make positive changes in one's life. Clear presents the idea that small, consistent improvements in daily habits can lead to significant long-term transformation. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the cues, cravings, responses, and rewards that drive habit loops and provides a framework for habit change. </p>
            <h3>Four laws of behavior change</h3>

                <div class="law-card">
                    <h3>The FIRST Law: Make it obvious</h3>
                    <p>This means making your desired habit (or goal) as evident and visible as possible to start.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you want to start reading more, you could put a book by your bed so you can pick it up as soon as you wake up.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="law-card">
                    <h3>The SECOND Law: Make it attractive</h3>
                    <p>This means making your desired habit something that you actually want to do EVERY SINGLE DAY.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you want to start reading more, you could find books that you’re REALLLY interested in.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="law-card">
                    <h3>The THIRD Law: Make it easy</h3>
                    <p>This means making your desired habit as simple as possible to do.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you want to meditate, you could start with just ONE minute each day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="law-card">
                    <h3>The FOURTH Law: Make it satisfying</h3>
                    <p>This means rewarding yourself for taking action on your desired habit, even if it’s a tiny change.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you want to lose weight, reward yourself with a healthy snack (such as a protein bar) after you run for a mile.</p>
