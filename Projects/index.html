            <h2>Amazon User Review Sentiment Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The project involves analyzing the sentiment of user reviews for products sold on Amazon. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a given review as positive, negative, or neutral.The project is to build and train a machine learning model using various natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, word embeddings, and recurrent neural networks.

            <h2> MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition</h2>
            <p>
                The Project is based on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The images are of size 28x28 pixels, and each pixel has a value between 0 and 255 representing the intensity of the pixel. The goal of the task is to build a machine learning model that can correctly classify the digit in each image. Different algorithms have been applied to it , including classifiers such as SVMs and neural network-based models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The best models achieve accuracy rates of over 99% on the test set.
